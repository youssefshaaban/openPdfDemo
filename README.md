#Ways of opening PDF in Android
If you want to display PDF in your Android application, there are various ways of doing it. Some of the ways of opening the PDF can be:

From Assets: Letâ€™s take an example, if you want to display some icons in your application then you will put all your icons in the drawable folder and then you will use those icons in your application. Same is with the case of PDF files also. If you have some PDF file that is constant and you want to display it in your application then you can put that PDF file in the assets folder and use that PDF in your app. One example can be the Terms and Conditions file. The terms and conditions files are rarely changed. So, you can put that document in the assets folder and use it.
From Device: The other way of opening a PDF is to open it from the device itself. Here, you can open the PDF files present in your mobile device. This is the most used approach for opening the PDF in an Android device.
From the Internet: Here, you can open PDF files from the internet. All you need to do is just use the URL of the PDF file and after downloading the PDF file, you can open the PDF file in your mobile application.
